What's new in version 5.6-stable:
=================================
	* Our program now uses the 'customtkinter' framework (which is based on the 'tkinter' framework)
	* Fixed the issue where widgets are oversized on 1024x768 or lower displays.
	* Created a separate banner file for low resolution displays (named "bannerlowres.png", and is available in the installation directory of the program).(***)
	* Our program now includes an Updater program, Say good bye to having to priodically visiting the Temp_Cleaner GUI's website to check if there is a new update or not.(**)
	* You can change whether if our program will have to check for updates automatically when you start it from the Settings page.
	* Removed the custom UI cursors.(****)
	* Created a new redesigned About window.(*****)
