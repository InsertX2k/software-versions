What's new in version 6.9-stable:
==============================
	[*] Fixed the issue with the Updater module that causes it to prevent Temp_Cleaner GUI from starting until it finishes checking for updates.
	[*] Improved the overall behavior of the Updater window & module.
	[+] Added a 25 seconds timeout for the check for updates function (to prevent the issue of the program staying in the background for too long)
	[*] Improved overall program exception handling
	[+] Improved the way Temp_Cleaner GUI displays and handles errors.
	[*] Major bug fixes and improvements to the behavior of some cleaners.
	[*] Minor improvements in overall code readability.
	[*] Now the Legacy Microsoft Edge Windows Store Version cleaner is automated! (I know this should have been automated since the first release of Temp_Cleaner GUI, I am sorry I forgot about it ;-;)
