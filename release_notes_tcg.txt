**If you are coming from an older version of Temp_Cleaner GUI, it is strongly recommended that you update your copy of Temp_Cleaner GUI to this release, as it contains important stability improvements and bug fixes**

=================================
	[*] Improved overall program stability (especially with older versions of Windows).
	[*] Major bug fixes.
	[*] Fixed the issues where sometimes Temp_Cleaner GUI overcleans.
	[*] Fixed the issue where the recycle bin cleaner doesn't clean the system drive recycle bin and doesn't find other drives.
	[*] Improved the behavior of Recycle bin cleaner
	[*] Improved Mozilla Firefox Cleaner.
	[*] Now the history cleaners are in separate cleaning options
	[+] Added Playnite Game Launcher Web Browser Cleaner
	[+] Added Opera Web Browser Cookies Cleaner*
	[+] Added Opera Web Browser Cache Cleaner*
	[+] Added Opera Web Browser History Cleaner*
 	[+] Added Help Document (HTML Files)**
*-I couldn't install Opera Web Browser (even through winget) so I had to build these cleaners using the community opinion (instead of searching and testing manually), so expect these cleaners to get updated in the upcoming updates to Temp_Cleaner GUI.
*-Cleans Stable version of Opera Browser Only
